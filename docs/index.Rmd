knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Covid Report
The total number of US covid cases is `r get_total_cases()`. The total number of US deaths is `r get_total_deaths()`. 

(**Note**: Why are there no commas in the *total number of US deaths* ? Can you change `analysis.R` file so that the number is commented with commas?)

Because the return line for total number of US deaths are not using the prettyNum function initially. I revised the code and now the number is commented with commas. 

I also want to show the chart:

``` {r echo=FALSE}
cases_plot
```
